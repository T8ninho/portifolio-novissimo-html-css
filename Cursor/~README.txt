Extras:
	-In case you want to use some of the "extras" instead of the standard cursor files, 
	just replace the original file in the folder with the extra and make sure to rename
	it to the original's name.
	
	i.e. 	1. drag "extra_move_2.cur" out of extra folder into main folder
		2. relocate original "move.cur" for safe keeping (put in "extra" folder maybe)
		3. rename "extra_move_2.cur" to "move.cur"
		4. make sure to delete scheme and reinstall if already installed prior to
		   replacing an orig with an extra
